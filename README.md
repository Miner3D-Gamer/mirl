- Console functions
- Dynamic window/rendering system
  - Supported: MiniFB (Full), GLFW (Mostly)
- Screenshots and other window manipulations
- Rust extensions (e.g., `.is_number()`, `.sign()`, `.average()`, comparing tuples ‚Äì functionality that _should_ be built-in)
- U1, U2, U4 with num-traits support (More to come)

### Hi there

What brought you to this place?

This is just a little big lib I built for easy function/struct reusability.

You can find the most random yet oddly specific things here.
