# Mirl

A library with a little bit of everything like:

- Math functions
- Graphics/Color modification
- Buffer Rendering (Texts, Lines, Triangles, Blocks, Circle)
- Console functions
- Dynamic Window/Rendering system (Supported: MiniFB [Full], Glfw [Mostly])
- Screenshots and other window manipulation
- Rust extensions (Simple function that should be built into rust for built-in types yet aren't for unexplainable reasons like .is_number() or .sign())

### Hi there

This is just a little personal lib for easy function/struct reusability
