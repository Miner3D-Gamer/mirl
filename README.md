# Mirl

A library with a little bit of everything like:

- Math functions
- Graphics/Color modification
- Rendering (Window)
- Rust extensions (Simple function that should be built into rust for built-in types yet aren't for unexplainable reasons like .is_number() or .sign())

### Hi there

What brought you to this place?

This is just a little personal lib for easy function/struct reusability
